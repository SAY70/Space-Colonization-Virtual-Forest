# 🌳 Procedural Tree Generation using MATLAB

## 📚 Overview
This MATLAB script implements a **procedural tree generation** algorithm that creates a forest of trees with varying structural properties. It employs a stochastic approach to generate tree parameters, simulate branching structures, and visualize the results in 3D. The model is designed for use in **radiorealistic vegetation modeling** and **LiDAR-based simulations**.

## 🛠 Key Features
- **Tree Population Control**: Adjust the number of trees, height range, and bud distribution.
- **Branching System**: Categorizes branches into **trunk, primary, secondary, tertiary**, and **non-use branches** based on their radius.
- **Randomized Positioning**: Uses a structured grid with offsets to distribute trees in a defined area.
- **3D Visualization**: Plots tree structures in a 3D environment with labeled receivers.
- **Receiver Perspective Analysis**: Simulates a receiver’s view of the forest and identifies visible branches.

## 🎯 Research Application
This script can be utilized in **remote sensing, forest ecology, and radiative transfer modeling** to analyze the impact of tree structures on wave propagation and environmental factors.

## 🔄 Workflow
1. **Initialize Parameters**: Define tree count, branch magnitude, height limits, and spatial distribution.
2. **Generate Trees**: Use randomized methods to define branching structures based on biological models.
3. **Classify Branches**: Segregate tree components based on diameter thresholds.
4. **Visualize Forest**: Plot trees in 3D with color-coded branches and receiver positions.
5. **Receiver Perspective Simulation**: Identify which tree components fall within the receiver’s cylindrical viewing range.
